# Turtle Random Polygon Art Generator

This program creates generative art using Python’s Turtle Graphics. It supports multiple drawing modes such as random polygons, fixed-shape polygons, and nested multi-layer polygons.

##  Features
- Draw random polygons (triangle, square, pentagon)
- Fixed polygon modes
- Nested multi-layer patterns
- Random mixed art mode
- Adjustable layers and repetition

##  How It Works
The program uses the `Polygons` class which can:
- Randomize size, color, position, orientation, and pen size  
- Draw a polygon  
- Draw nested polygons  
- Mass-generate drawings

User selects a mode (1–9) to generate different art patterns.

##  How to Run
1. Install Python 3  
2. Save the script as `art_generator.py`  
3. Run:

```
python art_generator.py
```

4. Enter a number between **1 and 9** to choose the art style.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- turtle (built-in)
- math (built-in)
- random (built-in)

## Future Enhancements
- Gradient line colors  
- Save art as image file  
- Add fractal designs  
- Create GUI menu  

Enjoy creating beautiful geometric art! 🎉
